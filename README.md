Forked from Mini Pan-Tilt Face Tracker to focus on numbers rather than faces, all hardware is the same, however the facetracker.py is amended to search for numbers and to digitse these.
==========================

You will need:
* Adafruit Mini Pan-Tilt Kit with Servos
* Adafruit 16-Channel Servo Driver
* A Pi Camera
* A long ribbon cable
* Some sort of power supply for your servos

You will also need to make sure your Pi is up-to-date:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo rpi-update

And install OpenCV for Python:

    sudo apt-get install python-opencv

To run this example, you should fire up your desktop with startx,
open up an LXTerminal window and run:

    ./facetracker.py


Note
----

You can use an Arduino to drive the servos, or drive them directly off your Pi, but I found the Servo Driver to be the most stable, reliable and satisfying method and thus this code is written with it in mind.
